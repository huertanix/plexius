Plexius
=======

Plexius is an open hardware lifecam system for Flickr I built while waiting for Narrative to launch. It combines the familiar aesthetic of older forms of wearable technology (traditional cameras with neckstraps) with DIY open hardware futurism. It also takes a photo every minute and uploads it to Flickr via wifi.

Dependencies
============

For the Plexius script, you'll want these things:
* Ruby 1.9
* flickraw gem

For the Plexius case, you'll want these:
* Access to a 3D printer
* Access to a laser cutter
* Patience

A full BOM for open hardware used is included (bom.md)

Install
=======

If you don't yet have Raspbian installed on an SD card for your Raspi, instructions for doing that (in Linux) are here:

To install/configure the raspberry pi camera with your pi, follow the instructions here: 

http://www.raspberrypi.org/camera

The camera install steps assume Raspbian, but other Linux distros like Arch might work too, try them out!
